# CASINO GAME

This is a Java implementation of the game [Craps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps).

This game has simple rules. 

A player rolls a pair of dice. 

The first roll, if the player rolls a 7 or an 11, they win the game.

If they roll a 2, 3, or 12, on the other hand, they lose the game.

If the player doesn't roll any of those values, the player has what's known as Point and the game continues.

If the player has Point, they have to keep rolling until they get either a 7, in which case they lose the game, or a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, in which case they win the game.
